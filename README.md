This project aimed to survey the realm of heart-stroke discovery and the potential of utilizing Quantum Computing to upgrade this critical facet of healthcare. Traditional designs for detecting heart strokes frequently encounter challenges related to their veracity and computational complexity. To overcome these restraints, Our system influences the unique possessions of quantum computing, particularly the phenomenon of destructive interference, to guarantee that clustering everything works correctly and is doable for requests in real-world questions. By joining the K-means clustering accompanying the quantum principles, our approach aims to provide a more accurate and adept discovery of heart stroke.
In our study, we conducted inclusive experiments utilizing various datasets of patients with accompanying heart stroke to judge the performance. The findings show that our method outperforms established patterns and former quantum methods, exhibiting superior veracity and adeptness in heart-stroke discovery. 
The ability to correctly and efficiently discover heart stroke using quantum-driven approaches can bring about proper mediation, upgraded patient outcomes, and diminished healthcare costs, which in a proper sequence will lead to a lower number of afterlife events from heart stroke. Moreover, the verdicts shed light on the potential of quantum computing to advance accuracy cure and personalized healthcare.
